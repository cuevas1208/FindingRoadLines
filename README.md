#**Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

##Usage
Create a pipeline to detect the road line segments in the image, then extrapolate them and draw them onto the image for display.

This project is part of the CarND program. Tools learned in class were used to identify lane lines on the road. 
Within some of the tools, we have color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Tranform line detection. In this project I explored and tried other techniques that were not presented in class.

##Quickstart
