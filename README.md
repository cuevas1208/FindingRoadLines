#**Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

This project is part of the CarND program. Tools learned in class were used to identify lane lines on the road. Whith in some of the tools, we have color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Tranform line detection. Whith in i the project I explored and try other techniques that were not presented in class. 

Obj: Create a pipeline to detect the line segments in the image, then average/extrapolate them and draw them onto the image for display.**
